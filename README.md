# Attempting to do heavy duty processing with a tiny CPU

This was an attempt to use bi-directional LSTM and a convnet to try to suppress the voices in songs, so only the music could be audible. (Reason: Karaoke)

We use pydub and scipy's wavfile to do filesystem edits to the audio and Short Term Fourier Transform to extract features and convert it into training data.

The project did not give satisfactory results, but it was a good learning experience.
